Estonia feels it is necessary to start the European Union’s military training mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) as soon as possible, Foreign Minister Urmas Paet said at the meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Brussels.

Estonia is prepared to send two staff officers to the European Union mission.

Paet said it is essential to successfully ward off the extremists and restore the political process in Mali. “It is important to follow the schedule compiled by the government of Mali, which sets the goals of organising free presidential and parliamentary relations, restoring the territorial integrity of the country, and achieving physical and social security as well as rule of law,” he added.

Estonia is concerned about violations of human rights in the parts of Mali that were under the control of rebels, the foreign minister said. “We recognise France and other European Union member states as well as countries in Western Africa that have made a contribution and taken decisive action in this critical situation. It is also essential that the extremists that are driven out of Mali do not find a new region for their activities,” he added.

In February a conference for all the countries contributing in Mali will be held at the initiative of the European Union in Brussels.
